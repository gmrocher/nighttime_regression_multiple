# nighttime_regression_multiple
The night time regression is a method used to calculate the gas transfer velocity in streams. 
The theory is that once photosynthesis ceases during the day, the oxygen concentration rises with a rate that is proportional to 
the reareation coefficient. Then, performing a linear regression between the oxygen deficit and the rate of change of oxygen as 
independent variable, the slope of the regression is equal to the reareation coefficient, which is the gas transfer velocity not 
corrected by the depth. See the article "Primary production in Flowing waters" by Howard T. Odum for further details and a full theory.
